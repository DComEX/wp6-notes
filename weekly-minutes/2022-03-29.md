## Minutes

- MGroup
    - The MPI integration for the linear algebra example was tested on Daint through pipeline
    - now testing CUDA integration with the ILGPU .NET bindings through two tests
        1. simple test that lists available devices. This works.
        2. cublas tests
    - both examples work locally at MGroup
    - current task is installing the right versions of CUDA and linking against them in the container.
    - Plan for the next week is to focus on CUDA+ILGPU in the container.

## Action Points

- [ ] MSolve: finish CUDA integration
- [ ] MSolve: integrate XUnit
