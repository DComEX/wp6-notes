# DCoMEX: WP 6 Planning

This is an engineering meeting, to plan the work to deliver the **DCoMEX Software Framework** version in M15 (June 2022).

The different partners have been busy working on development of software and researching algorithms. This deliverable packages up a first version of the software on a HPC system, for which we have four months. As such, the focus of the meeting is on the practical task of preparing the software for packaging and release.

## Agenda

* Update on staffing and resourcing at ETHZ partners (CSElab & CSCS).
* Update on the status of each product (MSolve-Korali-AISolve)
    * status of the software and preparation for HPC deployment.
* Decide on what has to be delivered for the "DCoMEX baseline prototype" in M15 (June 2022)
* Define responsibility for deliverable components
* Schedule a regular (weekly/fortnitely) engineering meeting

## Preparation

For the meeting, please prepare:
* A short (5 minutes) update for the component you are responsible for (MSolve-Korali-AISolve) if it is your responsibility.
    * status of the software and preparation for HPC deployment.
* Your understanding of what is in "the DCoMEX Software Framework"
    * Software components
    * The integration of components
