## Attendees

* Ben Cumming
* George Stavroulakis
* Andreas Fink
* Lucas Amoudruz

Apologies:
* Sam Omlin

## Action Points from last meeting

- [x] AF: look at error in CI/CD pipeline
- [x] GS: configure MSolve `/msolve`
    - [x] address comments then merge
    - [x] add building of MSolve to the CI
- [x] LA and GS: work on joining the "mocks" in `/integration`
- [ ] SO and AF: help via slack.

## Minutes

* the base image for the prototype is now in the CSCS artifactory, not DockerHub, and is set up to be built by a separate pipeline
* the mock was added
    * and extended to a full integration of MSolve + Korali with an example: https://github.com/DComEX/dcomex-prototype/pull/5
    * currently tests the interface between korali-msolve

* one remaining task for framework prototype: solve an inference problem
    * **option 1**: use the heat equation example
    * **option 2**: we can ask Vissarion or Yiannis

* what about overheads
    * bayesian inference might require in the order 10^4 samples.
    * heat example takes ~1s to run
    * order of 10s of minutes for 2 nodes on Daint-MC

* on testing in CI/CD
    * add the inference problem as a validation test
    * add unit test for a single call to MSolve
    * have `/tests/validation` and `/tests/unit`

* open source licensing of the framework:
    * MSolve: [Apache](https://github.com/mgroupntua/LinearAlgebra/blob/develop/License.txt)
    * Korali: MIT

* the M15 report topics:
    *  development process: weekly meetings with notes, GitHub repositories of the PoC
    *  requirements of Korali and MSolve
    *  containerised solution for providing a stable environment
    *  CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure
    *  integration of Korali+MSolve
    *  validation test/POC
    *  TODO: remaining steps for M24 deliverable.
