# DCOMEX Update Call

Date: 2023-10-05
Who: Andreas, Sebastian and Ben.

The end of the official WP 6 interval, when the DCOMEX Framework was delivered, was in June.

This was a pre-organised call to update ETH-CSCS on progress in the project, and to discuss possible future contributions from CSCS to assist with running large models with the Framework.

Sebastian:
- the project has been extended by 6 months, and the key deliverables around the DCOMEX-{BIO,MAT} models have been delayed by 6 months.
- so we dont

Ben:
- has the framework been used to develop the models, or are they being developed stand alone?

Sebastian:
- they are being developed stand alone.

Ben:
- there hasn't been any activity from the partners on the GitHub repos since June

Sebastian:
- CSELAB have run some more scaling tests and experiments with the Framework, using the allocation on Piz Daint @ CSCS.
- But large scale runs are pointless until the TUA team provide real-world models.

Ben:
- when should we organise the next meeting? Do we know when models will be available?

Sebastian:
- we don't have any updates on model availablility.

We all agreed that when the CSELab team know that the models are ready and it is time to start running on HPC centers, CSELab will contact CSCS to organise the next meeting with all of the stakeholders.
