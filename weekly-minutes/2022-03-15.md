## Action Points from last meeting

- [ ] Korali: second PR review for CI/CD and merge.
- [ ] George S: document requirements for MSolve (see Kanban)
- [ ] MPI integration in MSolve PoC.

## Topics

* The MSolve module
* Korali status update
* Update from CSCS

## Minutes

* MSolve and MPI
    * MPI .NET has to be built specifically for Linux MPI (versions on NuGet use Microsoft MPI)
    * Trying to find which MPI implementation can be used.
    * MGroup are investigating locally in an Ubuntu container.
    * Testing .NET and MPI runtime combinations in order to document them.
* CSCS offer to help with testing out .NET and MPI in container: probably the fastest way to do this testing.

Milestones:
1. MSolve PoC that demonstrates all the features we need for MSolve in prototype framework (w2 April)
    * tested via CI/CD at CSCS
2. a simple use case where Korali runs an MSolve model (possibly no MPI/GPU) (end April) 
3. Integration of MSolve + Korali at CSCS (end May)
    * requires a common base container image
    * merging of build definitions
    * implementation of test case 1
    * framework repository

* Further questions:
    * Do we need more examples of the integration?
    * What else is defined as "the DComEX Framework"
