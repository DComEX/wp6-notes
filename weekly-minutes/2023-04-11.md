# DCOMEX WP6 Weekly - 2023-04-04

## Attendees

* Ben Cumming
* Sergey Litvinov
* Sebastian Kaltenbach
* Andreas Fink

* George Stavroulakis

## Agenda

CSCS created a development project for access 

Sergey: how do we run the containerised application from Daint?
  * see notes on PR from Andreas https://github.com/DComEX/dcomex-prototype/pull/40#pullrequestreview-1379498440

Separation of user models from the framework
  * the prototype framework contains the DComEX Bio model work-in-progress
  * this is installed in the container by the Makefile
  * the container==the framework==korali+MSolve base libraries+glue
  * the model (e.g. DComEX bio) should be installed later by the user of the framework
    * in a separate container?
    * or they mount a path with the model and the framework provides an interface for integrating the model?

What about the TUM image processing tools?
  * no word

Testing plan:
  * run small-scale scaling tests with the DCOMEX-BIO model on Daint

Deliverable plan
  * separate model from framework
    * provide an example and documentation for the workflow on Daint
    * investigate installing python packages in a venv in the container.
    * move the framework with no model-specific code to a new repository
  * gather some benchmark results
  * write the deliverable document

## Minutes
