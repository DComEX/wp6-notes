## Minutes

Sergey:
- Framework was split into three parts
  1. korali
  2. msolve
  3. model
 - Still installed in one container, however with separate Makefiles.
 - They have run the tests on Daint directly using the workflow that Andreas proposed last meeting
    - so far they have rerun the integration tests
    - the next step is to run some scaling tests
 
 A user model is composed of two "files"
 - the mesh.
 - XML that describes the parameters.
 George proposes adding the model (physics etc) in the distributed MSolve code.
 - The final plan for how to distrubute the bio/mat
 
 The plan: finish Action items this week so that we can plan the deliverable next Tuesday.
