## Minutes

* MSolve for integration:
    * MSolve is a collection of libraries (FE, ML, and so on)
    * .NET has a package manager "nuget" https://www.nuget.org/
        * there is a common public server
        * and you can have private servers for internal testing
        * MGroup have one such private server
    * MSolve has been split: https://github.com/mgroupntua
    * two options:
        1. a single branch with all packages for DComEX
        2. integrate nuget into workflow
    * GS: initial proposal: start with PoC using 1. and migrate to 2.
        * Create a repository, e.g. in MGroup or DCOMEX.
        * incrementally add packages till we have the required set.

* GS: any documentation about CSCS platforms and processes?
    * General docs: https://user.cscs.ch/
    * For CI/CD external: we use GitLab internally
        * GitLab CI docs
        * Example of proposed Korali CI pipeline: https://github.com/cselab/korali/pull/624/files
        * See Useful links at bottom of page.

* Finish CI pipeline for Korali
    * GA: committed to review the CI PR with Daniel for next week

* Workflow and project management:
    * proposal: BC creates a timeline
    * counter proposal: define milestones as a team with dates
        * also define tasks as a team
        * BC keeps an eye on times and progress
