## Minutes

* MSolve for integration:
    * MSolve is a collection of libraries (FE, ML, and so on)
    * .NET has a package manager "nuget" https://www.nuget.org/
        * there is a common public server
        * and you can have private servers for internal testing
        * MGroup have one such private server
    * MSolve has been split: https://github.com/mgroupntua
    * two options:
        1. a single branch with all packages for DComEX
        2. integrate nuget into workflow
    * GS: initial proposal: start with PoC using 1. and migrate to 2.
        * Create a repository, e.g. in MGroup or DCOMEX.
        * incrementally add packages till we have the required set.

* GS: any documentation about CSCS platforms and processes?
