## Action Points from last meeting

**note** we had to skip last week's meeting dour to availability of attendees. We had the following update from the NTUA team, which I add here for the record:
  * xUnit is up and running
  * .NET 6.0 (that is the latest .NET) is used and has been integrated
  * MPI .NET with MPICH and distributed linear algebra solver tests are running using xUnit
  * All things are up at the GitHub repo and are integrated (to the best of my knowledge)

We had two action items from the meeting on 03-29 relating to the MSolve PoC:
- [x] MSolve: finish CUDA integration
- [x] MSolve: integrate XUnit

Regarding the milestones, after the work presented today we have ticked off a big one:
1. **DONE** MSolve PoC that demonstrates all the features we need for MSolve in prototype framework (w2 April)
    * tested via CI/CD at CSCS.
    * documentation of dependencies and requirements.
2. a simple use case where Korali runs an MSolve model (possibly no MPI/GPU) (end April) 
3. Integration of MSolve + Korali at CSCS (end May)
    * requires a common base container image
    * merging of build definitions
    * implementation of test case 1
    * framework repository

## Topics

* The MSolve module
* Korali status update
    * There is some uncertainty about contribution from CSE-lab

## Minutes

* MGroup:
    * The MSolve PoC has been finished.
    * Documentation of all requirements needs to be done
    * There is an MGroup-CSE-lab meeting to discuss the korali+MSolve coupling: Thursday 2022-04-14

* we could use the MSolve PoC repository for developing the integration of Milestone 2

* CSCS:
    * CI/CD pipelines have been running smoothly
    * No update from Korali devs about the distributed GPU test.
    * The CI/CD has been integrated for Korali and works (runs tests when comment with `cscs-ci` is made on the PR)

## Action Points

- [ ] Document MSolve dependencies and requirements in GitHub repo https://github.com/DComEX/software-catalogue
- [ ] Forward invitation to MGroup-CSElab meeting to CSCS if necessary
- [ ] Make decision on the the Korali+MSolve use case for first integration
- [ ] CSCS finalise attendance at the next DComEX meeting in Greece.
