## Agenda

## Minutes

- the MSolve module from MGroup have been merged and integrated with Korali in the repository
- Sergei and Sebastian are working on the UQ algorithm for that is efficient for these multi-scale models in WP 2 and WP 4
    - working on a few different approaches
- next step is to implement a baseline using features in Korali
    - there are preliminary results
    - there is some uncertainty about the values of the parameters in the provided parameter input files - possible scaling issues.
- Before proceeding with larger simulations MGroup can provide feedback on the parameters
- CSELab team would like to run some tests on Daint
    - circa 8-16 nodes
    - a development allocation would be sufficient
    - they need access

Overall, the Framework is coming together nicely, and we are ready to run some tests at scale.

## Action Items

- [x] MGroup provide example / template XML files for each direction to CSELab
- [x] PR with the DCOMEX-BIO prototype model (MSolve and Korali parts)
    - step 1 : MSolve model
    - step 2 : Korali wrapper
- [ ] MGroup provide an updated timeline for steps for the deliverable
- [ ] Ben: get a development project for DCOMEX project
- [ ] Andreas: fix access to the container artifacts on Daint for the project
- [ ] CSELab and MGroup define baseline values for the parameter
