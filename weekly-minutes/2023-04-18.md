## Minutes

We discuss how users will interact with one of the models, e.g. DComEx-bio?
- web app, manually uploaded to system, etc?

- we agree that a web-app would be the ideal interface
    - if we provide a container, the user has to log onto the hosting institution.
    - a web app is more accessible 
    - the main challenge with a web app is providing the choice of which system/provider to run on
        - there is no common API across EuroHPC sites for 
        - CSCS uses FireCrest
        - JSC uses Unicore

## Action Items

- [ ] Sergey: separate the "user-provided model" from the framework for DCOMEX-BIO
- [ ] Run some basic scaling tests to gather some benchmark results on Daint.
- [ ] Research REST APIs provided by eurohpc sites.
