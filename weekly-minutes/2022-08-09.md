# DComEX Weekly Dev Meeting 2022-08-09

[Kanban board](https://trello.com/b/EDF4PkRm/framework-prototype)
[GitHub](https://github.com/DComEX)

## Attendees

* Ben Cumming
* Andreas Fink
* Sam Omlin

## Action Points from last meeting

[ ] Ben writes to MGroup and project coordinator to get input on requirements for August 9 meeting.

- Next steps:
    - Define the expected use cases for the DCoMEX framework
    - based on use cases define:
        - API and UI requirements
        - HPC requirements for individual MSolve runs
            - e.g. MPI / multi-gpu.
    - start testing on Alps (more diverse node types)

## Notes on Framework

The project proposal has the following diagram of the "DCOMEX Pipeline"

**Module 1**: Data pre-processing

* TUM(?) are developing this software
* performs 3D feature detection.

**Module 2**: DMAP - Nonlinear learning on manifolds as surrogate models

* The surrogate model will be provided by the use case implementors
* The Framework will provide an interface for providing the surrogate framework?

**Module 3**: AI-Solve, an AI-enhanced linear system of equations solution library

* Developed by MGroup
* MSolve component

**Module 4**: Bayesian UQ Methods

* This is the Korali part?
* "In this project, all samplings will be done using the TMCMC algorithm"

**Module 5**: Computational Model

* The MSolve part?
* Use case specific, implemented in WP7
    * DCOMEX-BIO -- FEM models of tumors (UCY)
    * DCOMEX-MAT -- RVE FEM models (NTUA)
        * The research team of NTUA has developed a small scale version of the aforementioned model
        * **small scale model is a good candidate for next prototype**?
        * see page 17 of proposal

What is missing:
* data: inference assumes data
    * parameters

Interfaces for:
* providing Computational model and Surrogate model.
* specifying parameters for Bayesian Inference Method.

Next Step:
- NTUA provide, and help with integration of, small scale DCOMEX-MAT model.

## Minutes


## Action Points

- [ ] reach out to NTUA for small scale DCOMEX-MAT model.
