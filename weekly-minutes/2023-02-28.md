# DCOMEX WP6 Weekly - 2023-02-28

## Attendees

* Ben Cumming
* Sergey Litvinov

## Agenda

* Review feedback
    * WP6 == positive
    * request that the Framework be deployed on other JU systems
        * there appears to be some confussion about whether just the framework, or also the CI/CD deployment pipeline
* DCOMEX-BIO update
* plan next steps

## Minutes

* validation of the COMSOL and MGROUP model was demonstrated last week
    * the XML files and MSolve model for v1 are ready
    * the current model size is ~1000 points (small for testing)
    * MGroup folk will make PR to introduce these to the repository
* timeline for a HPC-ready model around end of March.

* instead of deploying CI/CD software we can build containers and push them to a public repository (e.g. DockerHub) for users of JU systems to download

* summary of Framework development:
    * implementing features from WP5 in the framework:
        * implement sampling framework that allows bayesian inference on arbitrary graph
            * https://github.com/DComEX/dcomex-prototype/blob/master/graph.py
        * examples of different methods
            * https://github.com/DComEX/dcomex-prototype/blob/master/examples/graph/README.md
    * Todo: add tests to CI/CD
